Add hadoop-common-3.1.1.jar and hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-0.23.1.jar to the classpath to run the programs.

Steps to execute the programs

1) Create a new Java project and add import the files
2) Add the jars to classpath
3) Create a jar file. 
4) run the below command to execute the program
  hadoop jar <jar_file_name> <Any one of the above class Containing Main method> <input file path> <output directory path>

If it is success, we can see different files created under the output directory
